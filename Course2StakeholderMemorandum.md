Subject: Botium Toys Internal Audit Overview

Dear Team,

We would like to bring to your attention the comprehensive examination of Botium Toys' internal systems, encompassing aspects such as scope, objectives, critical discoveries, and pertinent recommendations.

<ol>Scope:
<li>The evaluation will encompass the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, and SIEM tool. These systems will be assessed for:
  <ol>
  <li>Current user permissions</li>
  <li>Implemented controls</li>
  <li>Procedures and protocols in current use</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Validate that existing user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols align with PCI DSS and GDPR compliance mandates.</li>
<li>Ensure that both hardware and system access are accurately documented.</li>
</ol>
<ol>Goals:
<li>Adherence to NIST CSF standards.</li> 
<li>Establishment of a robust process to guarantee compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>
<li>Reinforcement of system controls.</li>
<li>Embrace the principle of least privilege in user credential management.</li>
<li>Formulation and implementation of comprehensive policies, including playbooks.</li>
<li>Assurance of compliance with all relevant regulatory standards.</li>
</ol>

<ol>Critical Findings (Immediate Attention Required):
<li>Development and implementation of multiple controls are imperative to meet the audit objectives. These include:</li>
  <ol>
  <li>Control of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties</li>
  <li>Disaster recovery plans</li>
  <li>Password, access control, and account management policies, including the implementation of a password management system</li>
 <li>Encryption (for secure website transactions)</li>
  <li>IDS</li>
  <li>Backups</li>
  <li>AV software</li>
  <li>CCTV</li>
  <li>Locks</li>
  <li>Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems</li>
  <li>Fire detection and prevention systems</li>
  </ol>
<li>Formulation and implementation of policies to align with PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC1, and SOC2 standards, specifically pertaining to user access policies and overall data safety.</li>
</ol>
<ol>Findings (Actionable, but not Immediate):</ol>
<li>Implementation of the following controls, where feasible, is advised:</li>
<ol>
  - Time-controlled safe</li>
  - Adequate lighting</li>
  - Locking cabinets</li>
  - Signage indicating alarm service provider</li>
</ol>

Summary/Recommendations:
It is strongly advised to promptly address critical findings relating to compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR, particularly given Botium Toys' global customer base and online payment acceptance.
Additionally, prioritizing the adaptation of least privilege principles and leveraging SOC1 and SOC2 guidance for user access policies and overall data security will be instrumental. 
The establishment of comprehensive disaster recovery plans and robust backup procedures is paramount to ensure uninterrupted business operations in the face of unforeseen incidents. 
Integration of IDS and AV software will significantly enhance our risk identification and mitigation capabilities, particularly in the case of legacy systems that require manual oversight. 
To bolster the security of assets housed at Botium Toys' primary physical location, utilization of locks and CCTV systems is strongly advised. While not immediately critical, 
implementing encryption, time-controlled safes, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, fire detection and prevention systems, as well as signage indicating the alarm service provider, 
will further bolster Botium Toys' overall security posture.

Your attention to these recommendations is greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,
Charles.
